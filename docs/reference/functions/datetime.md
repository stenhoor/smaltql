# Date and time functions

smaltdb has no separate date or time storage type. Dates and times are stored as ISO-8601 text (`'2024-03-15 13:45:30'`), as a julian day number (REAL), or as a Unix timestamp (INTEGER), and these functions convert between the three. They are a port of SQLite 3.54's `date.c` and are tested against SQLite's own WebAssembly build, so they give the same results, including NULL for invalid input. Functions SQLite doesn't have (`make_date`, date parts, `date_trunc`, `INTERVAL`, time zones) are in [Dates, times and zones](./dates).

| Function | Returns |
| --- | --- |
| [`date(TIME, MOD, …)`](#date) | `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| [`time(TIME, MOD, …)`](#time) | `HH:MM:SS` |
| [`datetime(TIME, MOD, …)`](#datetime) | `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` |
| [`julianday(TIME, MOD, …)`](#julianday) | Julian day number (REAL) |
| [`unixepoch(TIME, MOD, …)`](#unixepoch) | Seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC (INTEGER) |
| [`strftime(FORMAT, TIME, MOD, …)`](#strftime) | Text formatted by `FORMAT` |
| [`timediff(A, B)`](#timediff) | The difference `A - B` as `±YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS` |
| [`CURRENT_DATE`, `CURRENT_TIME`, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`](#current_date) | The current UTC date, time, or both |

All of them take a [time value](#time-values) followed by zero or more [modifiers](#modifiers), applied from left to right. Times are UTC unless you use the `localtime` modifier.

## Date and time columns {#columns}

SQL has no date types, but a table defined by another language (such as [smaltdf](https://stenhoor.github.io/smaltdf/))
or a Parquet file can have `date`, `datetime`, `time` and `duration` columns
([smaltdb ADR 0019](https://smaltdb.dev/adr/0019-dates-and-times)). SQL reads them as their text, as SQLite would hold
it: `2026-11-07`, `2026-11-07 12:30:00` (then `.123` or `.123456` when there is a fraction), `12:30:00`, and ISO 8601
durations such as `P1DT2H`. The functions on this page, `||`, `LIKE`, arithmetic, `CAST` and aggregates all see that
text, and results give it.

Comparisons give what comparing the text gives. Where that is the same as comparing the values, they compare the
values, so the engine can still use indexes and skip Parquet row groups:

- two columns of the same type (`a.d < b.d`);
- a column and a text literal written exactly as results write that type (`d > '2026-01-01'`,
  `ts >= '2026-11-07 12:30:00'`).

Other text compares as text: `ts > '2026-11-07'` is true from midnight on, as in SQLite, because `'2026-11-07 00:00:00'`
sorts after `'2026-11-07'`.

## Rules that apply to all functions {#rules}

- **NULL and errors**: if the time value or any modifier is NULL or cannot be parsed, or the result falls outside the supported range, the result is NULL. No error is raised.
- **Range**: from `-4713-11-24 12:00:00` (julian day 0) to `9999-12-31 23:59:59.999`.
- **No arguments**: `date()`, `time()`, `datetime()`, `julianday()` and `unixepoch()` with no arguments, and `strftime(FORMAT)` with only a format, use the current time, like `'now'`.
- **`'now'` is fixed per statement**: every use of `'now'` (and of `CURRENT_*`) in one execution of a statement sees the same instant, so all rows of a query get the same timestamp. The next execution reads the clock again.
- **Time zone**: `'localtime'` and `'utc'` use the time zone of the host (the browser or Node.js process) through JavaScript's `Date`.
- **Fractional seconds**: stored to the millisecond. The text results drop them unless you add the [`subsec`](#subsec) modifier.

```sql play
SELECT date('2024-02-30') AS rolled_over, date('2024-13-01') AS bad_month, datetime('nonsense') AS bad_text, date('10000-01-01') AS out_of_range, date(NULL) AS null_input;
```

| rolled_over | bad_month | bad_text | out_of_range | null_input |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-03-01 | NULL | NULL | NULL | NULL |

As in SQLite, a day of 29 to 31 that does not exist in the month is accepted and rolls over into the next month.

## Time values {#time-values}

The first argument (the second for `strftime`) is a time value in one of these forms:

| Form | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `YYYY-MM-DD` | `'2024-03-15'` | Midnight at the start of the day. |
| `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` | `'2024-03-15 13:45'` | |
| `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` | `'2024-03-15 13:45:30'` | |
| `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS` | `'2024-03-15 13:45:30.250'` | Any number of fraction digits; kept to the millisecond. |
| `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM…` | `'2024-03-15T13:45:30'` | A `T` may separate date and time. |
| `HH:MM`, `HH:MM:SS`, `HH:MM:SS.SSS` | `'13:45'` | A time alone: the date is `2000-01-01`. |
| any of the above + time zone | `'2024-03-15 13:45:30+02:00'`, `'…Z'` | `[+-]HH:MM` or `Z`, optionally after spaces. The time is converted to UTC. |
| `24:00` | `'2024-03-15 24:00'` | Midnight at the end of the day: the start of the next day. |
| `now` | `'now'` | The current time (UTC). |
| `subsec`, `subsecond` | `'subsec'` | The current time, and output includes milliseconds. |
| number | `2460385.0703125` | A julian day number, or with the `unixepoch` / `auto` modifiers a Unix timestamp. Numeric text such as `'2460385.0703125'` is the same. |

Years have exactly four digits, optionally preceded by `-` for years before year 0. Months and days need two digits. Leading spaces are not allowed; trailing spaces are.

```sql
SELECT datetime('2024-03-15T13:45:30.250') AS iso_t, datetime('13:45') AS time_only, datetime('2024-03-15 13:45:30+02:00') AS with_zone, datetime('2024-03-15 24:00') AS end_of_day, datetime(2460385.0703125) AS julian;
```

| iso_t | time_only | with_zone | end_of_day | julian |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-03-15 13:45:30 | 2000-01-01 13:45:00 | 2024-03-15 11:45:30 | 2024-03-16 00:00:00 | 2024-03-15 13:41:15 |

```sql
SELECT date('2024-1-5') AS one_digit_month, date(' 2024-01-05') AS leading_space, date('20240105') AS compact;
```

| one_digit_month | leading_space | compact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NULL | NULL | NULL |

## Modifiers {#modifiers}

Modifiers are text arguments after the time value. Names are case-insensitive. Each one transforms the result of the ones before it.

| Modifier | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `±N days`, `±N hours`, `±N minutes`, `±N seconds` | Add or subtract. `N` may have a fraction (`+1.5 hours`); the `+` is optional and the trailing `s` is optional (`+1 day`). |
| `±N months`, `±N years` | Add or subtract calendar months or years, keeping the day of the month; a day that does not exist rolls over (see `floor` / `ceiling`). A fraction is added as days (a month counts as 30 days, a year as 365). |
| `±HH:MM`, `±HH:MM:SS`, `±HH:MM:SS.SSS` | Add or subtract a time span. |
| `±YYYY-MM-DD`, `±YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM[:SS[.SSS]]` | Add or subtract years, months (0–11) and days (0–30), and optionally a time span. The sign is required. |
| `start of day` | Back to 00:00:00 of the day. |
| `start of month` | Back to the first day of the month, 00:00:00. |
| `start of year` | Back to January 1, 00:00:00. |
| `weekday N` | Forward to the next date whose weekday is `N` (0 = Sunday … 6 = Saturday), or no change if it already is. |
| `weekday -N` | Back to the most recent date whose weekday is `N`, or no change if it already is (SQLite 3.54). |
| `unixepoch` | The numeric time value is a Unix timestamp in seconds, not a julian day. Must be the first modifier. |
| `julianday` | The numeric time value is a julian day number (the default). Must be the first modifier. |
| `auto` | Guess: a number from 0 to 5373484.5 is a julian day, anything else a Unix timestamp. Must be the first modifier. |
| `localtime` | Convert from UTC to the host's local time. |
| `utc` | Convert from the host's local time to UTC. |
| `subsec`, `subsecond` | Include milliseconds in the output of `time`, `datetime`, `unixepoch` and `%s`. |
| `floor` | After a month or year addition that overflowed the month, go back to the last day of the intended month. |
| `ceiling` | After such an addition, keep the rolled-over date (the default behaviour). |

A modifier that does not parse, such as `'+1 fortnight'`, `'start of week'` or `'weekday 7'`, makes the result NULL.

### Adding and subtracting

```sql
SELECT date('2024-03-15', '+10 days') AS plus_days,
       datetime('2024-03-15 10:00', '+90 minutes') AS plus_minutes,
       datetime('2024-03-15 10:00', '+1.5 hours') AS fractional,
       date('2024-03-15', '-1 year') AS minus_year,
       datetime('2024-03-15 10:00', '+01:30') AS plus_hhmm,
       datetime('2024-03-15 10:00', '+0001-02-03') AS plus_ymd;
```

| plus_days | plus_minutes | fractional | minus_year | plus_hhmm | plus_ymd |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-03-25 | 2024-03-15 11:30:00 | 2024-03-15 11:30:00 | 2023-03-15 | 2024-03-15 11:30:00 | 2025-05-18 10:00:00 |

### Month ends: floor and ceiling {#floor}

Adding months keeps the day of the month. When that day does not exist, the date rolls over into the next month. `floor` goes back to the last day of the intended month instead:

```sql
SELECT date('2024-01-31', '+1 month') AS rolled,
       date('2024-01-31', '+1 month', 'floor') AS floor,
       date('2024-01-31', '+1 month', 'ceiling') AS ceiling,
       date('2024-02-29', '+1 year') AS leap_rolled,
       date('2024-02-29', '+1 year', 'floor') AS leap_floor;
```

| rolled | floor | ceiling | leap_rolled | leap_floor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-03-02 | 2024-02-29 | 2024-03-02 | 2025-03-01 | 2025-02-28 |

### Start of a period and weekdays

```sql
SELECT date('2024-03-15', 'start of month') AS month_start,
       date('2024-03-15', 'start of month', '+1 month', '-1 day') AS month_end,
       date('2024-03-15', 'start of year') AS year_start,
       datetime('2024-03-15 13:45:30', 'start of day') AS day_start,
       date('2024-03-15', 'weekday 0') AS next_sunday,
       date('2024-03-15', 'weekday -1') AS last_monday;
```

| month_start | month_end | year_start | day_start | next_sunday | last_monday |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-03-01 | 2024-03-31 | 2024-01-01 | 2024-03-15 00:00:00 | 2024-03-17 | 2024-03-11 |

2024-03-15 is a Friday. There is no `start of week` modifier; the Monday on or before a date is `date(d, 'weekday -1')`.

### Numbers: unixepoch, julianday and auto {#unixepoch-modifier}

```sql
SELECT datetime(1710510330, 'unixepoch') AS from_unix,
       datetime(1710510330.5, 'unixepoch', 'subsec') AS with_ms,
       datetime(2460385.5) AS from_julian,
       datetime(1710510330, 'auto') AS auto_unix,
       datetime(2460385.5, 'auto') AS auto_julian,
       datetime(1710510330, '+1 day', 'unixepoch') AS unixepoch_not_first;
```

| from_unix | with_ms | from_julian | auto_unix | auto_julian | unixepoch_not_first |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-03-15 13:45:30 | 2024-03-15 13:45:30.500 | 2024-03-16 00:00:00 | 2024-03-15 13:45:30 | 2024-03-16 00:00:00 | NULL |

### subsec {#subsec}

```sql
SELECT datetime('2024-03-15 13:45:30.25') AS plain, datetime('2024-03-15 13:45:30.25', 'subsec') AS subsec, time('13:45:30.987', 'subsec') AS time_ms;
```

| plain | subsec | time_ms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-03-15 13:45:30 | 2024-03-15 13:45:30.250 | 13:45:30.987 |

### localtime and utc {#localtime}

`localtime` and `utc` depend on the host's time zone, so their results vary between machines:

```sql
SELECT datetime('2024-03-15 13:45:30', 'localtime') AS local_time,
       datetime('2024-03-15 13:45:30', 'utc') AS from_local_to_utc,
       datetime('now', 'localtime') AS local_now;
```

## date {#date}

```
date(TIME, MOD, …)
```

The date as `YYYY-MM-DD` text. Years before 0 have a leading `-`.

```sql
SELECT date('2024-03-15 13:45:30') AS a, date(1710510330, 'unixepoch') AS b, date('2024-03-15', '+1 month') AS c;
```

| a | b | c |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-03-15 | 2024-03-15 | 2024-04-15 |

## time {#time}

```
time(TIME, MOD, …)
```

The time of day as `HH:MM:SS` text, or `HH:MM:SS.SSS` with `subsec`.

```sql
SELECT time('2024-03-15 13:45:30') AS a, time('13:45', '+30 minutes') AS b, time('10:00', '+15:30') AS c;
```

| a | b | c |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 13:45:30 | 14:15:00 | 01:30:00 |

## datetime {#datetime}

```
datetime(TIME, MOD, …)
```

The date and time as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` text, or `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS` with `subsec`. This is the format to store timestamps in: it sorts and compares correctly as text.

```sql
SELECT datetime('2024-03-15T13:45:30Z') AS a, datetime('2024-03-15', '+30 seconds') AS b, datetime('2024-03-15 13:45:30', 'start of day', '+1 day', '-1 second') AS end_of_day;
```

| a | b | end_of_day |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-03-15 13:45:30 | 2024-03-15 00:00:30 | 2024-03-15 23:59:59 |

## julianday {#julianday}

```
julianday(TIME, MOD, …)
```

The julian day number: days since noon UTC on November 24, 4714 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar, as a REAL. Subtracting two julian days gives a difference in days.

```sql
SELECT julianday('2024-03-15') AS a, julianday('2000-01-01 12:00') AS b, julianday('2024-03-16') - julianday('2024-03-01') AS days_between;
```

| a | b | days_between |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2460384.5 | 2451545 | 15 |

## unixepoch {#unixepoch}

```
unixepoch(TIME, MOD, …)
```

Seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, as an INTEGER (fractions are truncated). With the `subsec` modifier the result is a REAL with milliseconds.

```sql
SELECT unixepoch('2024-03-15 13:45:30') AS a, unixepoch('2024-03-15 13:45:30.250', 'subsec') AS b, unixepoch('1970-01-01') AS c, (unixepoch('2024-03-15 13:45') - unixepoch('2024-03-15 08:00')) / 60 AS minutes;
```

| a | b | c | minutes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1710510330 | 1710510330.25 | 0 | 345 |

::: warning Differs from SQLite
With `subsec`, a result that is a whole number of seconds is reported by `typeof` as `'integer'` (SQLite: `'real'`). The value is the same. See [Types](../sql/types).
:::

## strftime {#strftime}

```
strftime(FORMAT, TIME, MOD, …)
```

Formats the time with `FORMAT`, in which each `%` code below is replaced and every other character is copied. A NULL format gives NULL. An unknown code, such as `%Q`, makes the whole result NULL.

### Format codes {#format-codes}

Results below are for `'2024-03-05 08:04:09.125'`, a Tuesday.

## timediff {#timediff}

```
timediff(A, B)
```

The time from `B` to `A`, as text in the form `±YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS`: a sign, then whole years, months and days, then the remaining time. Months are calendar months counted from `B`, so the result can be added to `B` as a [modifier](#modifiers) to get `A`. Both arguments are time values; modifiers are not accepted. If either is NULL or invalid, the result is NULL.

```sql
SELECT timediff('2024-03-15', '2024-01-01') AS a,
       timediff('2024-01-01', '2024-03-15') AS b,
       timediff('2024-03-15 12:00:00.5', '2024-03-15 10:00') AS c,
       timediff('2025-03-01', '2024-02-29') AS d;
```

| a | b | c | d |

```sql
SELECT datetime('2024-01-01', timediff('2024-03-15 08:30', '2024-01-01')) AS round_trip;
```

| round_trip |

| 2024-03-15 08:30:00 |

## CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP {#current_date}

```
CURRENT_DATE
CURRENT_TIME
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
```

These are keywords, written without parentheses. They return the current UTC date (`YYYY-MM-DD`), time (`HH:MM:SS`) or both (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`) as text, the same as `date('now')`, `time('now')` and `datetime('now')`. They can also be column defaults (`created TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`); see [CREATE TABLE](../sql/create-table).

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATE = date('now') AS same_date, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP = datetime('now') AS same_timestamp, length(CURRENT_TIME) AS time_length;
```

| same_date | same_timestamp | time_length |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 8 |

The current time is read once per statement execution, so both sides above see the same instant. To show the actual values (they change on every run):

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, datetime('now', 'subsec') AS now_ms, unixepoch() AS epoch;
```

Writing them with parentheses, as in `current_date()`, is a syntax error (`SMALT_SYNTAX`), as in SQLite.

## In indexes and CHECK constraints {#indexes-and-check-constraints}

The date and time functions may be used in index expressions, in a partial index's `WHERE` clause, and in `CHECK` constraints. There, as in SQLite, a call that reads the clock or the time zone fails when it runs: a time value of `'now'`, `'subsec'` or `'subsecond'`, no time value at all (`date()`), and the `'localtime'` and `'utc'` modifiers. The error is `non-deterministic use of date() in an index` or `… in a CHECK constraint`, naming the function. Whether a call reads the clock can depend on the row, so the error comes from the row that does it, when it is inserted or updated (or when `CREATE INDEX` indexes the existing rows).

```sql
CREATE TABLE event(at TEXT);
CREATE INDEX event_day ON event(date(at));
INSERT INTO event VALUES ('2024-03-15 13:45:30');
SELECT at FROM event WHERE date(at) = '2024-03-15'
```

| at |
| --- |
| 2024-03-15 13:45:30 |

<!-- docs:error SMALT_ERROR -->
```sql
INSERT INTO event VALUES ('now')
```

`CURRENT_DATE`, `CURRENT_TIME` and `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` are always prohibited in an index (`non-deterministic functions prohibited in index expressions`). A `DEFAULT` may use any of them.

## Differences from SQLite {#differences}

The results match SQLite 3.54 with these exceptions:

- `'now'` is read once per statement execution. SQLite guarantees a stable `'now'` only within one step of a statement, so a long query in SQLite can see the clock move; in smaltdb it cannot.
- A REAL result with no fractional part, such as `unixepoch(…, 'subsec')` on a whole second, reports `typeof` `'integer'`.
- Modifier chains whose intermediate values exceed about ±2^53 milliseconds (e.g. `'+400000000000000 seconds', '-400000000000000 seconds'`) can be off by a few milliseconds, because smaltdb computes in JavaScript doubles where SQLite uses 64-bit integers.
