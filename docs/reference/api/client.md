# Client API

The client runs on the page (or in any worker), starts the engine in its own Web Worker, and talks to it with messages. Every call returns a promise. `open()` comes from `smaltql`, which starts an engine worker that reads SQL; everything else on this page is the `smaltdb` package's client (`smaltql` re-exports the `Database` and `OpenOptions` types).

```ts
import { open, type Database } from 'smaltql';
import { SmaltdbError } from 'smaltdb';
```

The guide explains the concepts: [databases](../../guide/databases), [queries](../../guide/queries), [transactions](../../guide/transactions), [import and export](../../guide/import-export), [errors](../../guide/errors). For the in-process engine, see [`smaltdb/engine`](https://smaltdb.dev/reference/api/engine).

Import and export, registered files and credentials come from [plugins](../../guide/plugins), not from `smaltdb`. Their helpers are listed under [Plugin helpers](#plugin-helpers).

## open

`open(name: string, options?: OpenOptions): Promise<Database>`

Starts an engine worker (or, with multi-tab access, joins the tab that owns the database) and opens the database `name`, creating it if it does not exist. Resolves when the database is open.

```ts
import { open } from 'smaltql';

const db = await open('app');
const temp = await open('temp', { storage: 'memory' });
```

`name` identifies the database within the origin. For OPFS storage the files are `smaltdb/<name>.db` and siblings; see [storage](../../guide/databases#storage). The name `':memory:'` always opens an in-memory database.

Rejects with `SMALT_BUSY` if another engine worker holds the OPFS file without sharing it, and with `SMALT_WORKER` if the worker cannot be started.

### OpenOptions

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `storage` | `'opfs'` \| `'memory'` | `'opfs'` | `'opfs'` persists in the Origin Private File System; `'memory'` is discarded on close. |
| `pageSize` | `number` | `8192` | Page size in bytes for a new database (a power of two, 512 to 65536). Ignored for an existing one. |
| `cacheMB` | `number` | `16` | Page cache budget in MiB. |
| `durable` | `boolean` | `true` | Flush to storage on every commit. With `false`, recent commits can be lost in a crash. |
| `worker` | `() => Worker` \| `URL` \| `string` \| `Worker` | smaltql's worker, `smaltql/worker` | Where the engine worker comes from: a function that starts it (use this for a worker entry with [plugins](../../guide/plugins)), a script URL (started as a module worker) or a `Worker`. See [loading the engine worker](../../guide/getting-started#loading-the-engine-worker). |
| `multiTab` | `boolean` | `true` for OPFS when `navigator.locks` and `BroadcastChannel` exist | Share the database with other tabs of the origin. Never applies to in-memory databases. See [multi-tab access](../../guide/databases#multi-tab-access). |

## Database

An open database, returned by `open()`. It implements [`Queryable`](#queryable).

### query

`db.query<T, M>(sql: string, params?: Params, options?: QueryOptions & { rowMode?: M }): Promise<…>`

Runs one statement and resolves to all its rows. The result type depends on `rowMode`:

| `rowMode` | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `'object'` or omitted | `T[]`, where `T` defaults to `Record<string, SqlValue>` |
| `'array'` | [`ArrayResult`](#arrayresult) |
| `'columnar'` | [`ColumnarResult`](#columnarresult) |

```ts
const people = await db.query<{ name: string; age: number }>('SELECT name, age FROM people WHERE age >= ?', [18]);
const table = await db.query('SELECT name, age FROM people', undefined, { rowMode: 'array' });
const cols = await db.query('SELECT age FROM people', undefined, { rowMode: 'columnar' });
```

`T` is not checked at run time. A statement without rows (an `INSERT` without `RETURNING`) runs and resolves to `[]`. Several statements in `sql` reject with `SMALT_SYNTAX`. While a [`transaction`](#transaction) of this `Database` runs, the call waits until it ends.

### exec

`db.exec(sql: string, params?: Params, options?: { signal?: AbortSignal }): Promise<RunResult>`

Runs statements for their effect. With `params`, `sql` must be a single statement. Without `params`, `sql` may be a script of statements separated by `;`, run in order, each committing on its own unless the script has `BEGIN … COMMIT`.

```ts
await db.exec('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS kv(k TEXT PRIMARY KEY, v TEXT)');
const { changes } = await db.exec('UPDATE kv SET v = ? WHERE k = ?', ['on', 'theme']);
```

Resolves to a [`RunResult`](#runresult). For a script, `changes` is that of the script's last `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`, or `0` if it has none; for a single statement other than those (a `SELECT`, DDL), it is `0`. With `params` and several statements, rejects with `SMALT_MISUSE`. `exec` calls on one `Database` run in call order and wait for a running [`transaction`](#transaction).

### stream

`db.stream<T, M>(sql: string, params?: Params, options?: StreamOptions & { rowMode?: M }): AsyncIterableIterator<…>`

Runs one statement and returns an async iterator over batches of rows. Each batch has the shape `query` would return for its `rowMode` (`T[]`, `ArrayResult` or `ColumnarResult`), with at most `batchSize` rows.

```ts
let total = 0;
for await (const batch of db.stream<{ amount: number }>('SELECT amount FROM payments', undefined, { batchSize: 1000 })) {
  for (const row of batch) total += row.amount;
}
```

The engine sends at most `highWaterMark` batches ahead and then waits for the loop. Leaving the loop early closes the result. While a stream is open on the owning engine worker, writes from this tab reject with `SMALT_BUSY`; see [streaming](../../guide/queries#streaming). Called while a [`transaction`](#transaction) of this `Database` runs, the stream starts when the transaction has ended; to stream inside the transaction, use `tx.stream`.

### prepare

`db.prepare(sql: string): Promise<PreparedStatement>`

Compiles one statement in the engine and resolves to a [`PreparedStatement`](#preparedstatement). Rejects with the statement's error (syntax, unknown table or column) at once.

```ts
const byId = await db.prepare('SELECT * FROM people WHERE id = ?');
const [person] = await byId.query([42]);
await byId.finalize();
```

### queryPlan

`db.queryPlan(stmt: PlanStatementInput, params?: PlanParams, options?: QueryOptions): Promise<…>`

`db.preparePlan(stmt: PlanStatementInput): Promise<PreparedStatement>`

Run, or prepare, a statement given as plan data instead of SQL: the engine's own description of a query or a write, which every language builds. The plan format is **experimental**: it may change in any release until smaltdf, its first user besides SQL, has proven it. Its types, builders and codec are in `smaltdb/plan`, a separate entry point so that pages which don't build plans don't load them; the [engine reference](https://smaltdb.dev/reference/api/engine#plans) describes `PlanStatementInput` and the builders. Parameters are positional (`PlanParams` is an array). Results, options, transactions and parallel readers work as for [`query`](#query); a statement from `preparePlan` is an ordinary [`PreparedStatement`](#preparedstatement). The plan crosses to the engine worker as JSON, and the engine validates it: an invalid plan rejects with [`SMALT_PLAN`](https://smaltdb.dev/reference/api/errors#smalt-plan).

```ts
import { open } from 'smaltql';
import * as p from 'smaltdb/plan';

const db = await open('app');
await db.exec("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS people(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT); INSERT OR IGNORE INTO people VALUES (1, 'Ada'), (2, 'Lin')");
// SELECT name FROM people WHERE id = ?
const byId = p.project(p.filter(p.scan('people', [0, 1]), p.call('cmp_eq', [p.col(0, 0, 'int'), p.param(0, 'int')], 'int')), [p.col(0, 1, 'text')]);
const rows = await db.queryPlan<{ name: string }>({ kind: 'query', plan: byId, columns: [{ name: 'name', type: 'text' }] }, [2]); // [{ name: 'Lin' }]
```

### transaction

`db.transaction<T>(fn: (tx: Transaction) => Promise<T>): Promise<T>`

Runs `fn` in a transaction: `BEGIN`, then `fn(tx)`, then `COMMIT` when the promise `fn` returns resolves, or `ROLLBACK` when it rejects (the error is passed on). Resolves to `fn`'s result.

```ts
const id = await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
  const r = await tx.exec('INSERT INTO orders(customer) VALUES (?)', ['ann']);
  await tx.exec('INSERT INTO order_lines(order_id, item) VALUES (?, ?)', [r.lastInsertRowid, 'tea']);
  return r.lastInsertRowid;
});
```

Run statements through `tx` (a [`Transaction`](#transaction-1)). While `fn` runs, every other call on the same `Database` and its prepared statements (`query`, `exec`, `stream`, `prepare`, `transaction`, `callPlugin` with `lock` (such as the `@smaltdb/io` helpers), `close`, and `query`, `stream` and `run` of a `PreparedStatement`) waits for the transaction to end, so awaiting one inside `fn` never finishes. Rejects with `SMALT_ERROR` if a transaction opened with SQL `BEGIN` is already open.

If `fn` ends the transaction itself through `tx`: after a `COMMIT`, the promise resolves to `fn`'s result; after a `ROLLBACK`, it rejects with `SMALT_ERROR` ("the transaction was rolled back inside the transaction callback"). See [transactions](../../guide/transactions).

### callPlugin

`db.callPlugin(plugin: string, method: string, args: unknown[], options?: { lock?: boolean; replay?: string; dropReplay?: boolean; signal?: AbortSignal }): Promise<unknown>`

Calls method `method` of plugin `plugin` in the engine worker, and resolves to its result. `args` and the result are sent with `postMessage`, so they must be values the browser can clone. Plugins export typed [helpers](#plugin-helpers) that call this, so applications rarely call it directly.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `lock` | Wait for earlier `exec` calls and transactions of this `Database`, and hold off later ones while the call runs, as `exec` does. |
| `replay` | A key under which the call is sent again to a new engine worker when this tab takes over a shared database (for state that lives in the worker, such as registered files). A later call with the same key replaces it. |
| `dropReplay` | With `replay`: forget the call stored under that key. The call itself is still sent. |
| `signal` | Cancels the call; it then rejects with `SMALT_INTERRUPT`. |

Rejects with `SMALT_PLUGIN_MISSING` when the engine does not have the plugin, and with `SMALT_MISUSE` when the plugin has no such method. See [Writing plugins](https://smaltdb.dev/reference/api/plugins#calling-plugin-methods).

```ts
const result = await db.callPlugin('@smaltdb/io', 'exportCSV', ['SELECT 1 AS x', null, {}], { lock: true });
console.log(result); // 'x\n1\n'
```

### onPluginMessage

`db.onPluginMessage(plugin: string, handler: ((message: unknown) => unknown) | null): void`

Answers questions that plugin `plugin` asks this tab from the engine (for example, `@smaltdb/external` asks for fresh credentials for one request). The handler's return value, or the value its promise resolves to, is the answer. If it throws, the plugin's question fails with the error's message. One handler per plugin; `null` removes it. `registerCredentials` from `@smaltdb/external/client` sets its own handler, so applications rarely call this. See [Writing plugins](https://smaltdb.dev/reference/api/plugins#asking-the-client).

### Plugin helpers

These functions come from the plugins' client modules. Each takes the `Database` first, and calls [`callPlugin`](#callplugin). The engine worker must have the plugin installed; see [plugins](../../guide/plugins).

| Helper | Module | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `importCSV(db, table: string, source: ImportSource, options?: CsvImportOptions): Promise<{ rows: number }>` | `@smaltdb/io/client` | Insert CSV records into `table`. See [importCSV](../../guide/import-export#importcsv). |
| `importJSON(db, table: string, source: ImportSource, options?: JsonImportOptions): Promise<{ rows: number }>` | `@smaltdb/io/client` | Insert a JSON array or NDJSON. See [importJSON](../../guide/import-export#importjson). |
| `exportCSV(db, sql: string, params?: ExportParams, options?: CsvExportOptions): Promise<string>` | `@smaltdb/io/client` | A query's result as CSV. See [exportCSV](../../guide/import-export#exportcsv). |
| `exportJSON(db, sql: string, params?: ExportParams, options?: JsonExportOptions): Promise<string>` | `@smaltdb/io/client` | A query's result as JSON or NDJSON. See [exportJSON](../../guide/import-export#exportjson). |
| `registerFile(db, name: string, file: FileSource \| null): Promise<void>` | `@smaltdb/external/client` | Make `file` readable as `file:<name>`; `null` removes it. See [registering files](../../guide/external-data#registering-files). |
| `registerCredentials(db, name: string, provider: CredentialsProvider \| null): Promise<void>` | `@smaltdb/external/client` | Credentials a connection names; `null` removes them. See [credentials](../../guide/external-data#credentials). |
| `setFetch(db, fetchFn: FetchFn \| null): Promise<void>` | `@smaltdb/external/client` | Replace the transport for HTTP(S), S3 and Azure requests. A function cannot be sent to a worker, so this works with the in-process engine only. |

The import and export helpers pass `lock: true`. `registerFile` and `registerCredentials` pass a `replay` key (`file:<name>`, `cred:<name>`), so a new owner tab gets them again, and `dropReplay` when you pass `null`.

```ts
import { importCSV, exportCSV } from '@smaltdb/io/client';
import { registerFile } from '@smaltdb/external/client';

await registerFile(db, 'prices.csv', new Blob(['id,price\n1,9.5\n']));
const rows = await db.query("SELECT * FROM read_csv('file:prices.csv')");
await importCSV(db, 'people', 'name,age\nAnn,31\nBob,27\n', { create: true });
const csv = await exportCSV(db, 'SELECT name, age FROM people ORDER BY name');
```

### close

`db.close(): Promise<void>`

Closes the database. In the tab that owns the engine worker, it closes the files and terminates the worker; in other tabs it detaches. Waits for a running transaction and earlier `exec` calls. Calling it again does nothing; other calls on a closed database reject with `SMALT_MISUSE`.

### isLeader

`db.isLeader: boolean`

Whether this tab's engine worker owns the database. Always `true` without multi-tab access. With it, `false` in tabs that send their requests to another tab, until they take over.

### stats

`db.stats: { readerQueries: number; ownerQueries: number; morselQueries: number }`

Counts of queries answered by [parallel reader](../../guide/databases#parallel-readers) workers, by the owning engine worker, and by merging partial aggregates computed on readers. For diagnostics.

### Other members

`epoch` and the methods marked `@internal` in the type declarations (`attachWorker`, `attachShared`, `request`, `cancel`, `withLock`, `afterTransaction`, `rawQuery`, `rawExec`, `openStream`, `replayRegistrations`) are used by the client itself and are not part of the API.

## PreparedStatement

A statement compiled by [`db.prepare()`](#prepare). It belongs to the engine worker that prepared it.

| Member | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `columns` | `string[]` (read-only) | Result column names; `[]` for statements without rows. |
| `paramCount` | `number` (read-only) | Number of parameter slots. |
| `query` | `query<T, M>(params?: Params, options?: QueryOptions & { rowMode?: M }): Promise<…>` | Run and resolve to the rows, as [`db.query`](#query). |
| `stream` | `stream<T, M>(params?: Params, options?: StreamOptions & { rowMode?: M }): AsyncIterableIterator<…>` | Run and stream the rows, as [`db.stream`](#stream). |
| `run` | `run(params?: Params, options?: { signal?: AbortSignal }): Promise<RunResult>` | Run for effect, as [`db.exec`](#exec). |
| `finalize` | `finalize(): Promise<void>` | Free the statement. Later calls reject with `SMALT_MISUSE`. |

```ts
const insert = await db.prepare('INSERT INTO log(level, msg) VALUES (:level, :msg)');
for (const msg of ['started', 'ready']) await insert.run({ level: 'info', msg });
await insert.finalize();
```

While a [`transaction`](#transaction) of the `Database` runs, `query`, `stream` and `run` wait for it to end, like the `Database` methods; `run` also runs in call order with `exec`. Inside the transaction, use [`tx.statement(stmt)`](#transactionstatement). The members `db`, `rawQuery`, `rawStream` and `rawRun` are internal. With multi-tab access, a statement prepared before the owning tab changed rejects with `SMALT_RETRY` (`finalize` resolves without doing anything); prepare it again.

## SmaltdbError

`class SmaltdbError extends Error { readonly code: string }`

The error every failed call rejects with. `code` is one of the [error codes](https://smaltdb.dev/reference/api/errors); `name` is `'SmaltdbError'`.

```ts
import { SmaltdbError } from 'smaltdb';

try {
  await db.exec('INSERT INTO kv(k, v) VALUES (?, ?)', ['theme', 'dark']);
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof SmaltdbError && e.code === 'SMALT_CONSTRAINT_PRIMARYKEY') {
    await db.exec('UPDATE kv SET v = ? WHERE k = ?', ['dark', 'theme']);
  } else throw e;
}
```

## Types

### Queryable

```ts
import type { Queryable } from 'smaltdb';

async function countRows(q: Queryable, table: 'people' | 'orders'): Promise<number> {
  const [row] = await q.query<{ n: number }>(`SELECT count(*) AS n FROM ${table}`);
  return row.n;
}
```

`query`, `exec` and `queryPlan`, with the same signatures as on `Database`. `Database` and the [`Transaction`](#transaction-1) handle implement it, so functions that take a `Queryable` work inside and outside transactions.

### Transaction

The `tx` argument of [`transaction`](#transaction). Everything run through it is part of the transaction. It works only while the callback runs: afterwards, its methods (and those of statements from `statement`) reject with `SMALT_MISUSE`.

| Member | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `query` | as [`db.query`](#query) | Run a query in the transaction. |
| `exec` | as [`db.exec`](#exec) | Run statements in the transaction. |
| `stream` | as [`db.stream`](#stream) | Stream a query's result in the transaction. |
| `statement` | `statement(stmt: PreparedStatement): TransactionStatement` | Use a statement prepared on this `Database` in the transaction. Throws `SMALT_MISUSE` for a statement of another `Database`. |

```ts
const insert = await db.prepare('INSERT INTO log(level, msg) VALUES (?, ?)');
await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
  const ins = tx.statement(insert);
  await ins.run(['info', 'one']);
  await ins.run(['info', 'two']);
});
```

### TransactionStatement

A prepared statement used through [`tx.statement()`](#transaction-1): `columns`, `paramCount`, and `query`, `stream` and `run` with the signatures of [`PreparedStatement`](#preparedstatement), running in the transaction. It has no `finalize`: finalize the `PreparedStatement` itself.

### QueryOptions

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rowMode` | [`RowMode`](#rowmode) | `'object'` | Shape of the rows. |
| `batchSize` | `number` | `4096` | Rows per batch sent from the engine worker. |
| `signal` | `AbortSignal` | | Cancels the call. See [cancellation](../../guide/queries#cancellation). |

### StreamOptions

`QueryOptions` plus:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `highWaterMark` | `number` | `4` | Batches the engine may send ahead of the consumer (at least 1). |

### RowMode

`type RowMode = 'object' | 'array' | 'columnar'`

### RunResult

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `changes` | `number` | Rows changed by the `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`; `0` for other statements. |
| `lastInsertRowid` | `number` \| `bigint` | The rowid of the most recent successful `INSERT` on the engine's connection. |

### ArrayResult

`interface ArrayResult extends Array<SqlValue[]> { columns: string[] }`

Rows as value arrays, with the column names in `columns`.

### ColumnarResult

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `columns` | `string[]` | Column names. |
| `length` | `number` | Number of rows. |
| `data` | `Record<string, Float64Array \| SqlValue[]>` | One entry per column name: a `Float64Array` when every value is a number (no NULL), else an array of values. |

### SqlValue

`type SqlValue = null | number | bigint | string | Uint8Array`

A SQL value in JavaScript: NULL, INTEGER (`number`, or `bigint` outside ±(2^53 − 1)), REAL, TEXT and BLOB. See [values](../../guide/queries#values).

### Params

`type Params = readonly (SqlValue | boolean | undefined)[] | Readonly<Record<string, SqlValue | boolean>>`

Positional values for `?` / `?NNN`, or an object for `:name`, `@name` and `$name`. `true` and `false` bind as `1` and `0`, `undefined` in an array as NULL, and `NaN` as NULL. A `bigint` outside the 64-bit INTEGER range, and an object for a statement with `?` or `?NNN` placeholders, reject with `SMALT_RANGE`. See [parameters](../../guide/queries#parameters).

## Plugin helper types

These types are exported by the plugins' client modules, not by `smaltdb`: `ImportSource`, `ExportParams`, `CsvImportOptions`, `JsonImportOptions`, `CsvExportOptions` and `JsonExportOptions` by `@smaltdb/io/client`, and `FileSource`, `CredentialsProvider`, `AwsKeys`, `AzureAuth` and `FetchFn` by `@smaltdb/external/client`.

### ImportSource

`type ImportSource = string | Uint8Array | ArrayBuffer | Blob`

Text, UTF-8 bytes, or a `Blob` / `File`.

### ExportParams

`type ExportParams = readonly ParamValue[] | Readonly<Record<string, ParamValue>>`, where `ParamValue` is `null | number | bigint | string | Uint8Array | boolean | undefined`. Positional values, or named ones for `:name`, `$name` and `@name`, as for [`Params`](#params).

### CsvImportOptions

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `header` | `boolean` | `true` | The first record names the columns. Without it, fields map to the table's columns in order. |
| `columns` | `string[]` | | Target columns, overriding the header. |
| `delimiter` | `string` | `','` | Single-character field separator. |
| `quote` | `string` | `'"'` | Single-character quote. |
| `emptyAsNull` | `boolean` | `true` | Unquoted empty fields become NULL; quoted `""` is always an empty string. |
| `create` | `boolean` | `false` | Create a missing table, inferring `INTEGER`, `REAL` or `TEXT` per column. If the import fails, the table is removed again. |

### JsonImportOptions

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `columns` | `string[]` | the table's columns | Target columns for arrays of arrays. |
| `create` | `boolean` | `false` | Create a missing table, inferring column types from the values. If the import fails, the table is removed again. |

### CsvExportOptions

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `header` | `boolean` | `true` | Write a header line. |
| `delimiter` | `string` | `','` | Field separator. |
| `nullString` | `string` | `''` | Text for NULL. |
| `crlf` | `boolean` | `false` | CRLF line endings instead of LF. |

### JsonExportOptions

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `format` | `'array'` \| `'ndjson'` | `'array'` | One JSON array of objects, or one object per line. |

### FileSource

`type FileSource = Blob | Uint8Array | ArrayBuffer | string | { getFile(): Promise<Blob> }`

A `File` or `Blob`, bytes, text, or a file handle such as a `FileSystemFileHandle` (`getFile()` is called on each read).

### CredentialsProvider

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `endpoint` | `string` | Credentials are used only for request URLs that start with this string. |
| `headers` | `Record<string, string>` or `(url: string) => Record<string, string> \| Promise<…>` | Extra request headers, such as `authorization`. |
| `aws` | `{ accessKeyId, secretAccessKey, sessionToken? }` or a function returning it (or a promise of it) | Keys to sign requests on `s3` connections (Signature Version 4). |
| `azure` | `{ sasToken }` \| `{ accountKey }` \| `{ bearerToken }`, or a function returning one | Authentication for `azure` connections. |
| `presign` | `(url: string, method: 'GET' \| 'HEAD') => string \| Promise<string>` | Returns a presigned URL to fetch instead of `url`. |

When any part is a function (`presign` always is), the whole provider stays in this tab: the engine worker gets only the `endpoint`, and asks this tab for the credentials of each request. A request then fails with `SMALT_EXTERNAL` if no answer comes within 30 seconds, or when the tab has closed; the engine drops the credentials when the tab closes. See [external data](../../guide/external-data#credentials).

### FetchFn

`type FetchFn = (url: string, init: { method?: 'GET' | 'HEAD'; headers: Record<string, string>; signal?: AbortSignal }) => Promise<{ ok: boolean; status: number; statusText: string; headers: { get(name: string): string | null }; arrayBuffer(): Promise<ArrayBuffer> }>`

The subset of `fetch` that `@smaltdb/external` uses. The global `fetch` fits it.
