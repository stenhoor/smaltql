# Window functions

A window function computes a value for each row from a set of related rows (its *window*), without collapsing the rows the way `GROUP BY` does. smaltdb implements SQLite's window functions with the same results and, except where noted, the same error messages.

## Functions {#functions}

### Ranking

- [`row_number`](./row_number): The number of the row within its partition, starting at 1.
- [`rank`](./rank): The `row_number` of the first peer of the current row: ties share a rank, and a gap follows them.
- [`dense_rank`](./dense_rank): The number of the current row's peer group, starting at 1: ties share a rank, and there are no gaps.
- [`percent_rank`](./percent_rank): `(rank - 1) / (rows in partition - 1)`, a REAL from 0 to 1.
- [`cume_dist`](./cume_dist): The number of rows up to and including the current row's last peer, divided by the number of rows in the partition.
- [`ntile`](./ntile): Splits the partition into `N` buckets of nearly equal size and returns the bucket number (1 to `N`) of the current row.

### Navigation

- [`lag`](./lag): `X` evaluated on the row `OFFSET` rows before the current one in the partition (default 1).
- [`lead`](./lead): Like `lag`, but looks `OFFSET` rows after the current one.
- [`first_value`](./first_value): `X` evaluated on the first row of the frame.
- [`last_value`](./last_value): `X` evaluated on the last row of the frame.
- [`nth_value`](./nth_value): `X` evaluated on the `N`-th row of the frame (counting from 1), or NULL if the frame has fewer rows.

## Syntax summary

This is a summary; the full grammar, including the `WINDOW` clause, is in [SELECT](../../sql/select).

```
function(args) [FILTER (WHERE condition)] OVER window_name
function(args) [FILTER (WHERE condition)] OVER ( [base_window] [PARTITION BY expr, …] [ORDER BY term, …] [frame] )

frame:   {ROWS | RANGE | GROUPS} start
       | {ROWS | RANGE | GROUPS} BETWEEN start AND end
         [EXCLUDE {NO OTHERS | CURRENT ROW | GROUP | TIES}]
start, end:
         UNBOUNDED PRECEDING | N PRECEDING | CURRENT ROW | N FOLLOWING | UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
```

- **`PARTITION BY`** splits the rows into independent partitions. Without it, all rows form one partition.
- **`ORDER BY`** orders the rows within each partition. Rows with equal `ORDER BY` values are *peers*. `NULLS FIRST` / `NULLS LAST` are accepted.
- **Frame**: the rows an aggregate or `first_value` / `last_value` / `nth_value` sees. The default frame is `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` (the current row and all its peers) when there is an `ORDER BY`, and the whole partition when there is not. `ROWS` counts rows, `GROUPS` counts peer groups, and `RANGE` with `N PRECEDING` / `N FOLLOWING` compares the `ORDER BY` value (it requires exactly one `ORDER BY` term). With only a start bound, the end is `CURRENT ROW`.
- **`EXCLUDE`** removes rows from the frame: the current row, its peer group, or its peers but not itself (`TIES`).
- **Named windows**: `WINDOW w AS (…)` in the `SELECT`, then `OVER w`, or `OVER (w ORDER BY …)` to add an `ORDER BY` to a window that has none. A window that has a frame cannot be extended.
- **`FILTER`** works with aggregate functions used as window functions, not with the built-in window functions.
- `DISTINCT` is not allowed in a window function call.
- Window functions are allowed in the select list and `ORDER BY`, not in `WHERE`, `GROUP BY` or `HAVING`. They can take aggregates as arguments, e.g. `rank() OVER (ORDER BY count(*) DESC)`.

The examples use this table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE score(player TEXT, team TEXT, points INT);
INSERT INTO score VALUES
  ('ann', 'red', 10), ('bob', 'red', 20), ('cat', 'red', 20),
  ('dan', 'blue', 5), ('eve', 'blue', 15);
```

## Ranking functions

The ranking functions take no arguments and use the window's `ORDER BY` (without one, every row is a peer of every other).

## Navigation functions

### IGNORE NULLS, RESPECT NULLS {#ignore-nulls}

```
lag(X …) IGNORE NULLS OVER (…)
lag(X …) RESPECT NULLS OVER (…)
```

Written between a navigation function's call and `OVER`, `IGNORE NULLS` makes `lag`, `lead`, `first_value`,
`last_value` and `nth_value` skip the rows where `X` is NULL: `lag` gives the nearest earlier non-NULL value, and so
on. Without it, NULLs count as rows, as in SQLite; `RESPECT NULLS` says so explicitly and changes nothing. Other window functions take neither. A smaltdb extension.

```sql
SELECT i, x, lag(x) OVER (ORDER BY i) AS prev, lag(x) IGNORE NULLS OVER (ORDER BY i) AS prev_value,
       first_value(x) IGNORE NULLS OVER (ORDER BY i) AS first_value
FROM (SELECT 1 AS i, NULL AS x UNION ALL SELECT 2, 10 UNION ALL SELECT 3, NULL UNION ALL SELECT 4, 30)
ORDER BY i;
```

| i | x | prev | prev_value | first_value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | NULL | NULL | NULL | NULL |
| 2 | 10 | NULL | NULL | 10 |
| 3 | NULL | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| 4 | 30 | NULL | 10 | 10 |

On any other window function either clause fails with `SMALT_ERROR`: `sum(x) IGNORE NULLS OVER ()` gives `IGNORE NULLS is not valid for sum(): only lag, lead, first_value, last_value and nth_value take it`.

## Aggregate functions as window functions {#aggregate-functions-as-window-functions}

Every [aggregate function](../aggregate/) (`count`, `sum`, `total`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `group_concat`, `string_agg`) becomes a window function when it has an `OVER` clause. It then aggregates the rows of the current row's frame, and `FILTER (WHERE …)` restricts which frame rows count. Scalar functions cannot be used with `OVER` (`abs() may not be used as a window function`).

Running totals and moving averages:

```sql
SELECT player, points,
       sum(points) OVER (ORDER BY points, player) AS running,
       avg(points) OVER (ORDER BY points, player ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING) AS moving_avg,
       sum(points) OVER (PARTITION BY team) AS team_total,
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE points >= 15) OVER () AS high_scorers
FROM score
ORDER BY points, player;
```

| player | points | running | moving_avg | team_total | high_scorers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dan | 5 | 5 | 7.5 | 20 | 3 |
| ann | 10 | 15 | 10 | 50 | 3 |
| eve | 15 | 30 | 15 | 20 | 3 |
| bob | 20 | 50 | 18.333333333333332 | 50 | 3 |
| cat | 20 | 70 | 20 | 50 | 3 |

Frame units and exclusions. `RANGE 5 PRECEDING` covers rows whose `points` value is within 5 of the current one; `GROUPS` counts peer groups; `EXCLUDE CURRENT ROW` leaves the current row out:

```sql
SELECT player, points,
       count(*) OVER (ORDER BY points RANGE BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS within_5,
       count(*) OVER (ORDER BY points GROUPS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 1 FOLLOWING) AS this_and_next_group,
       sum(points) OVER (ORDER BY points ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING EXCLUDE CURRENT ROW) AS others
FROM score
ORDER BY points, player;
```

| player | points | within_5 | this_and_next_group | others |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dan | 5 | 1 | 2 | 65 |
| ann | 10 | 2 | 2 | 60 |
| eve | 15 | 2 | 3 | 55 |
| bob | 20 | 3 | 2 | 50 |
| cat | 20 | 3 | 2 | 50 |

## Errors

| Message | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `misuse of window function f()` | A window function inside `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, or inside another window function's arguments (`f` is the inner function, as in SQLite), or a built-in window function such as `row_number()` without `OVER`. |
| `f() may not be used as a window function` | `OVER` on a scalar function. |
| `DISTINCT is not supported for window functions` | `count(DISTINCT x) OVER (…)`. |
| `FILTER clause may only be used with aggregate window functions` | `FILTER` on `rank()` and the other built-in window functions. |
| `no such window: w` | `OVER w` with no `WINDOW w AS (…)`. |
| `unsupported frame specification` | A frame that starts after it ends, e.g. `BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 1 PRECEDING`. |
| `RANGE with offset PRECEDING/FOLLOWING requires one ORDER BY expression` | `RANGE N PRECEDING` with zero or several `ORDER BY` terms. |
| `frame starting offset must be a non-negative integer` | `N PRECEDING` / `N FOLLOWING` that is not a non-negative integer in a `ROWS` or `GROUPS` frame (`… non-negative number` for `RANGE`; `frame ending offset …` for the end bound). |
| `cannot override frame specification of window: w` | `OVER (w ORDER BY …)` where `w` has a frame. |

All are `SMALT_ERROR`.

To filter on a window function, compute it in a subquery or CTE:

```sql
SELECT player, points FROM (
  SELECT player, points, rank() OVER (PARTITION BY team ORDER BY points DESC) AS r FROM score
) WHERE r = 1 ORDER BY player;
```

| player | points |
| --- | --- |
| bob | 20 |
| cat | 20 |
| eve | 15 |
